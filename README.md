## Python Homework - Py Me Up, Charlie

Created a new repository for this project called python-challenge. 

Created a directory for each Python Challenge: PyBank and  PyPoll.

Inside of each folder the following has been added:

A file called main.py. This will be the main script to run for each analysis.

A "Resources" folder that contains the CSV files used.

An "Analysis" folder that contains the text file that has the results from the analysis.
